      <TextArea layoutX="25.0" layoutY="23.0" prefHeight="453.0" prefWidth="447.0" stylesheets="@styles.css" text="Thank you for using TMC scanner!&#10;&#10;This program is designed to display weather event changes &#10;detected by weather sensors located on Wyoming roads. &#10;&#10;The program is seperated by 3 panels: The left function panel,&#10; the top table view, and the bottom table view.&#10;&#10;The columns of each table can be dragged to a preferred size,&#10;and can be clicked on to display events ordered by the selected&#10;column. In addition, the dividing column between the two tables&#10;can be dragged up or down in order to make one table larger than&#10;the other. &#10;&#10;The top table view is a display for general events. These &#10;consists of changes in precipitation, changes in wind&#10; incrementation (for example, 45 MPH winds changing to &#10;50 MPH), and, if selected, alerts to drop wind or black ice &#10;notifications. The table can be cleaned by clicking &quot;Clear&quot;&#10; on the left panel. &#10;&#10;The bottom table view is a display for priority events. &#10;This includes, but is not limited to, strong wind warnings, &#10;low visibility warnings, watch for black ice warnings, and &#10;notifications to close/open roads due to Extreme Blowover&#10; Risks (EBOR). These alarms will flash red when they appear, &#10;and give a noise alert. Clicking &quot;Acknowledge&quot; on the left panel &#10;will stop the noise alert and the red flashing. However, events &#10;will remain on the list. &#10;&#10;Settings: &#10;To change settings, navigate to File &gt; Settings.&#10;In order to save settings, you must click the save button when &#10;completed. Otherwise, clicking exit will not save the changes &#10;you have made.&#10;&#10;Disable Precipitation Changes: Top table will no longer show   &#10;events where rain or snow is added or removed. &#10;&#10;Disable Wind Incrementation:  Top table will no longer show if &#10;wind alerts higher than 40 mph vary by 5 MPH or more (I.E: alerts&#10;specifying &quot;Wind changed from 40+ MPH to 45+ MPH&quot;)&#10;&#10;Make Drop Alerts Priority: Instead of appearing in the top general&#10; table, any alerts specified to remove a condition will be shown in &#10;the bottom priority table with a flashing alert. This includes &quot;Drop&#10; black ice warning&quot;, &quot;Drop Strong Wind&quot;, and &quot;Drop Low Visibility&#10; alert&quot;. This does not include alerts related to EBOR. &#10;&#10;Disable Wind/Black Ice/Visibility Alarm sound: This will prevent &#10;these types of alerts from producing a bell noise on alert, but will &#10;still flash red. These may be helpful if there are many alerts on a &#10;condition to filter out the most important alarms. &#10;&#10;Lead Operator Mode: This mode was made for lead operators to&#10; monitor priority alerts in all districts while still able to focus on &#10;their own selected districts. General rows will show only what &#10;districts are selected, and while all priority alerts will show, &#10;the alarm will only sound for selected districts. &#10;&#10;" />
