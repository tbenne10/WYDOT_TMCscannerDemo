These consists of changes in precipitation, changes in wind incrementation (for example, 45 MPH winds changing to 50 MPH), and, if selected, alerts to drop wind or black ice notifications. The table can be cleaned by clicking &quot;Clear&quot; on the left panel. &#10;&#10;The bottom table view is a display for priority events. This includes, but is not limited to, strong wind warnings, low visibility warnings, watch for black ice warnings, and notifications to close/open roads due to Extreme Blowover Risks (EBOR). These alarms will flash red when they appear, and give a noise alert. Clicking &quot;Acknowledge&quot; on the left panel will stop the noise alert and the red flashing. However, events will remain on the list. &#10;&#10;Settings: &#10;To change settings, navigate to File &gt; Settings.&#10;In order to save settings, you must click the save button when completed. Otherwise, clicking exit will not save the changes you have made.&#10;&#10;Disable Precipitation Changes: Top table will no longer show   events where rain or snow is added or removed. &#10;&#10;Disable Wind Incrementation:  Top table will no longer show if wind alerts higher than 40 mph vary by 5 MPH or more (I.E: alert specifying &quot;Wind changed from 40+ MPH to 45+ MPH&quot;)&#10;&#10;Make Drop Alerts Priority: Instead of appearing in the top general table, any alerts specified to remove a condition will be shown in the bottom priority table with a flashing alert. This includes &quot;Drop black ice warning&quot;, &quot;Drop Strong Wind&quot;, and &quot;Drop Low Visibility alert&quot;. This does not include alerts related to EBOR. &#10;&#10;Disable Wind/Black Ice/Visibility Alarm sound: This will prevent these types of alerts from producing a bell noise on alert, but will still flash red. These may be helpful if there are many alerts on a condition to filter out the most important alarms. &#10;&#10;Lead Operator Mode: This mode was made for lead operators to monitor priority alerts in all districts while still able to focus on their own selected districts. General rows will show only what districts are selected, and while all priority alerts will show, the alarm will only sound for selected districts. &#10;&#10;" unFocusColor="#d0bebe">
