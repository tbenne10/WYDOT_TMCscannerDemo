# WYDOT_TMCscannerDemo
RWIS sensor weather event view for use by WYDOT Transportation Management Center

This program allows for TMC employees to observe changes in weather conditions posted by sensor data retrieved via FTP. This is a demo version to demonstrate conditions from several mock files. Particular features include percipitation changes, high wind warnings, black ice watch, and wind road closure recommendations. It features a (top) table for general events and (bottom) table for priority events.

Requires Java 8 to run. 

To run the mock program, navigate to out>artifacts>scannerdemo>TMCscannerDemo.jar. Logs will be saved in resources/logs.

If you are a member of TMC for another state and are interested in implementing this program to your own state's needs, please contact me via GitHub.
